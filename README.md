# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors

The Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors project is to simulate a rock-paper-scissors game with your computer. It uses a TensorFlow model to identify if you are holding up 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors' or 'nothing' to your camera.

## Milestone 1 - Creating the Model

The model was created using Teachable Machine with Google. It is a standard image-based model using four classes - Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. The images for the classes to train the model were captured by the developer and then exported as a TensorFlow Keras model.
